    "In the example above, the data provide us with full knowledge about the exact itinerary taken by each passenger. However, we are often confronted with situations where we do not have such detailed information about paths. Nevertheless, we often have aggregate information that allows us to generate path statistics: Consider a setting where we know (1) the topology of a transportation network, and (2) the origin and destination stations of individual passengers, i.e. where passengers start and finish their journey. Under the assumption that passengers travel along shortest paths, we can now use this information to extract the path statistics that we need. \n",

For the situation described above, we can use the `pp.path_extraction.paths_from_origin_destination` method to generate path statistics based on tuples capturing origin/destination statistics and an instance of the class `Network`. Let us try this in a toy example.\n",
